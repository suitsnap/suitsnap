## Hiya! 
I'm Suit (or Xander) and I'm an 18 year old self-taught, software developer from the United Kingdom 🇬🇧!

Development 🖥️
---
I specialise in Java and Kotlin development specifically in the Minecraft ecosytem! 
I do Plugin and Mod development in all versions of the game and am familiar with the DevOps tasks involved.
Outside of Minecraft development, I also do Full Stack Web Development, Database Management in a variety of tools from MongoDB to SQL.

Personal Life ☀️
---
In my personal life, I enjoy bouldering 🧗‍♂️, walking my dog Arlo and cycling! I also am very passionate about linguistics and etymology, I speak about ~5 languages, although each to different levels. 
Unsurprisingly, I also enjoy playing video games, especially in the survival genre, such as The Forest, Terraria and Minecraft!
